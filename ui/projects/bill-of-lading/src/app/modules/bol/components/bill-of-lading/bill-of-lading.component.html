<p>
  A Bill of Lading (BOL) is required to ship freight and plays a crucial role in making sure your
  shipment is transported quickly and efficiently. If you have a guaranteed or volume/truckload
  shipment, be sure to indicate your service level and include your quote number on your printed
  BOL. And, donâ€™t forget you can save some time by requesting your pickup within our Bill of Lading
  application. Another convenient feature allows you to save your work as a draft or template if you
  get partially done with your BOL and need to come back later.
