  <p>
    BOL History shows all current Bills of Lading created for this My Estes account. 
    You can sort the columns by clicking one of the arrows that appears when you hover 
    over the column headers for BOL Reference #, BOL Date, PRO #, Shipper, Consignee, and Shipping Labels.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can also view previously-created labels or create new labels for your BOLs. 
    The "View Labels" link lets you view previously-created labels. The "Create Labels" link 
    opens a pop-up window, where you can create new labels by selecting the label type and size, 
    the starting labelâ€™s position and the number of labels you want to print.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can work with a Bill of Lading from the list by selecting one of the icons next 
    to the Shipping Labels option for that particular BOL. As an example, you can copy the 
    report and use it to create a new report by clicking the copy icon. This takes you to the 
    "Create BOL" section of the application, where you can edit the data and save it as your new BOL. 
    Other icon options include the ability to view a .pdf and cancel the BOL if the BOL Date field is in the future.
